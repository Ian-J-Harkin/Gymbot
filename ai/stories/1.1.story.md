Title: Epic 1, Story 1: Initialize NestJS Project and Basic Configuration

Goal: To create the foundational NestJS application, establishing the project structure and initial configuration, preparing it for future feature development.

User Story: As a developer, I want a clean, new NestJS project set up with the standard project structure and environment variable management so that I can begin building the API features.

Requirements:

Initialize a new NestJS project named fitbot-api.

Use the NestJS CLI to generate the initial application skeleton.

Implement a configuration module (ConfigModule) to manage environment variables using the @nestjs/config package.

Create a .env.example file with placeholder variables for the database connection and application port.

Ensure the application starts successfully and listens on the port defined in the environment variables.

Acceptance Criteria:

A new NestJS project exists in the fitbot-api/ directory.

The project structure matches the one defined in docs/project-structure.md.

A .env file can be created from .env.example to configure the application.

Running npm run start:dev successfully starts the server without errors.

The server responds to a basic GET request at the root URL.

Technical Context:

Framework: NestJS (with TypeScript)

Package Manager: npm

Environment Variables: Use dotenv via @nestjs/config.

Project Structure Reference:

fitbot-api/
├── src/
│   ├── common/
│   └── app.module.ts
└── package.json
Testing Requirements:

A single e2e test should verify that the root endpoint (/) returns the default Hello World! response.
