Title: Epic 3, Story 1: Implement API Key Generation and Management

Goal: To create an endpoint that allows a logged-in user to generate a public-facing API key for their widget.

User Story: As a logged-in user, I want to generate a unique API key so that I can securely connect my WordPress plugin to my FitBot configuration.

Requirements:

Create an ApiKeysModule.

Create a POST /api-keys endpoint protected by the AuthGuard.

When called, this endpoint should:

Generate a new, cryptographically random, unique string for the key.

Create a new ApiKey record in the database.

Link the new ApiKey to the user's Configuration.

If a key already exists, it should be revoked or replaced.

Return the newly generated key to the user.

Acceptance Criteria:

Calling POST /api-keys as an authenticated user generates and returns a new API key string.

The key is stored in the ApiKey table and correctly linked to the user's configuration.

The key is sufficiently random and unique.

Calling the endpoint again invalidates the old key and creates a new one.

Technical Context:

Endpoint: POST /api-keys

Data Models: ApiKey, Configuration

Key Generation: Use crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex') or a similar method.

Authentication: JWT AuthGuard.

Testing Requirements:

Create e2e tests for the POST /api-keys endpoint, verifying that it returns a key and that the key is correctly stored in the database.
