Title: Epic 2, Story 3: CRUD for User Configurations

Goal: To create the API endpoints that allow an authenticated user to create, read, and update their chatbot configuration.

User Story: As a logged-in user, I want to be able to save and retrieve my chatbot's settings (FAQ text, color, OpenAI Key) so that I can configure how my chatbot behaves.

Requirements:

Create a ConfigurationsModule in NestJS.

Create a GET /configurations/me endpoint:

It must be protected by the AuthGuard.

It should retrieve and return the Configuration linked to the authenticated user.

It should decrypt the openAiApiKey before returning it to the user.

Create a PUT /configurations/me endpoint:

It must be protected by the AuthGuard.

It should create or update the configuration for the user.

It must accept faqText, widgetColor, and openAiApiKey.

It must use the EncryptionService to encrypt the openAiApiKey before saving.

Acceptance Criteria:

Making a request to GET /configurations/me without a valid JWT returns a 401 Unauthorized error.

When a logged-in user hits GET /configurations/me, they receive their specific configuration data.

When a logged-in user hits PUT /configurations/me, their settings are updated in the database.

The openAiApiKey is always stored in an encrypted format in the database.

Technical Context:

Endpoints: GET /configurations/me, PUT /configurations/me

Data Models: Configuration, User

Services: EncryptionService

Authentication: The endpoint must be protected by the JWT AuthGuard.

Testing Requirements:

Create e2e tests for both endpoints. Tests should include authentication checks, successful data retrieval, and successful data updates.
