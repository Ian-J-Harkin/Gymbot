Title: Epic 5, Story 1: Initialize React Project (Vite + TypeScript) for Admin Portal

Goal: To set up the foundational frontend project for the FitBot Admin Portal using React, Vite, and TypeScript.

User Story: As a developer, I need a new, clean React project set up with a fast development server and type safety so I can start building the admin UI components.

Requirements:

Initialize a new React project named fitbot-admin-portal using the Vite build tool.

Select the react-ts template.

Set up the project structure as defined in the architectural plan.

Configure a proxy in vite.config.ts to forward /api requests to the backend server (e.g., http://localhost:3000) to avoid CORS issues during development.

Install axios for making API requests.

Acceptance Criteria:

A new React project exists in the fitbot-admin-portal/ directory.

The project structure is created as specified.

Running npm run dev starts the Vite development server successfully.

The proxy is configured, and a test API call from the frontend to a backend endpoint works correctly.

axios is installed and ready for use.

Technical Context:

Framework: React with TypeScript

Build Tool: Vite

Project Structure Reference:

├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── features/
│   ├── lib/
│   ├── App.tsx
│   └── main.tsx
└── package.json
Testing Requirements:

No automated tests are required for this setup story. Manual verification of the dev server and proxy is sufficient.
