Title: Epic 1, Story 2: Integrate Prisma and Connect to PostgreSQL Database

Goal: To connect the NestJS application to the PostgreSQL database using Prisma, enabling type-safe database access.

User Story: As a developer, I want to integrate Prisma into the NestJS application and establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database so that API modules can query and mutate data.

Requirements:

Add Prisma to the fitbot-api project.

Initialize Prisma with the PostgreSQL provider.

Configure the database connection URL via environment variables.

Create a PrismaService that can be injected into other services to provide access to the Prisma Client.

The PrismaService should handle connecting to the database on application startup and disconnecting gracefully on shutdown.

Acceptance Criteria:

The prisma/schema.prisma file is created and configured for a PostgreSQL database.

The DATABASE_URL is loaded from the .env file.

The application can successfully connect to the PostgreSQL database when it starts.

npx prisma migrate dev can be run successfully (even if there are no model changes yet).

A PrismaService is available for dependency injection within the NestJS application.

Technical Context:

Database: PostgreSQL

ORM: Prisma

NestJS Integration: Follow the official NestJS + Prisma integration guide (creating a PrismaService that extends PrismaClient).

Environment Variable: DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"

Testing Requirements:

A unit test should ensure the PrismaService can be instantiated.

An e2e test should attempt to inject the PrismaService into a test module to confirm the connection is established.
