Title: Epic 4, Story 1: Create Public Endpoint to Fetch Widget Configuration

Goal: To create a public-facing, API-key-authenticated endpoint that the chat widget can use to fetch its non-sensitive configuration.

User Story: As the chat widget, I need to fetch my configuration (like widget color) using my API key so that I can render myself correctly on the client's website.

Requirements:

Create a WidgetModule and a WidgetController.

Create a GET /widget/config endpoint.

Implement an ApiKeyAuthGuard to protect this endpoint. The guard must:

Extract the API key from the X-API-Key request header.

Validate that the key exists and is active in the ApiKey table.

Attach the corresponding Configuration to the request object for use by the controller.

The endpoint should return only public-safe data: widgetColor.

It must NOT return sensitive data like faqText or the openAiApiKey.

Acceptance Criteria:

A request to GET /widget/config without an X-API-Key header fails with a 401 error.

A request with an invalid API key fails with a 401 error.

A request with a valid API key returns a 200 OK and a JSON object containing the correct widgetColor.

The response body does not contain any sensitive configuration data.

Technical Context:

Endpoint: GET /widget/config

Authentication: Custom ApiKeyAuthGuard checking the X-API-Key header.

Data Models: ApiKey, Configuration

Testing Requirements:

Create e2e tests for the /widget/config endpoint, covering invalid/missing keys and a successful data fetch.
