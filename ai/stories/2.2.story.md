Title: Epic 2, Story 2: Implement Encryption Service for Sensitive Data

Goal: To create a reusable service for encrypting and decrypting sensitive data, such as the user's OpenAI API Key, before storing it in the database.

User Story: As a developer, I want a secure way to store sensitive user-provided credentials so that even in the event of a database breach, the keys are not exposed.

Requirements:

Create an EncryptionService in the common/services directory.

Use Node.js's built-in crypto module.

The service must provide two methods: encrypt(text) and decrypt(hash).

Use a strong, symmetric encryption algorithm like AES-256-GCM.

The encryption key and initialization vector (IV) secret must be loaded from environment variables.

Integrate this service into the Configurations module to encrypt the openAiApiKey field before saving it to the database.

Acceptance Criteria:

An EncryptionService is created and can be injected into other modules.

Calling encrypt() on a string returns an object containing the IV and the encrypted content.

Calling decrypt() with the object returned by encrypt() returns the original string.

The ENCRYPTION_KEY and IV_SECRET are managed via environment variables and are not hardcoded.

The service is used by the configuration logic to secure the OpenAI API key.

Technical Context:

Algorithm: AES-256-GCM is recommended.

Module: Node.js crypto

Environment Variables: ENCRYPTION_KEY (32 characters), IV_SECRET (16 characters)

Testing Requirements:

Create unit tests for the EncryptionService to verify that the encrypt and decrypt functions work correctly and are symmetrical.
